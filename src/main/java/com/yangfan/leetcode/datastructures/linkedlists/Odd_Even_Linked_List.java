/**
 * 328. Odd Even Linked List
 * Given the head of a singly linked list,
 * group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices,
 * and return the reordered list.
 *
 * The first node is considered odd, and the second node is even, and so on.
 * Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.
 * You must solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) time complexity.
